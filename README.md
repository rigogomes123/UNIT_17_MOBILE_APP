# Produce designs for a mobile app to meet identified requirements:

### Introduction:

You have been contacted by a local wellness spa and gym. They know you have completed a lot of research on mobile applications previously and have seen your web article. They want you to create a bespoke habit tracking application. Their only key requirements are the following:

Should be able to track the amount of water someone has drunk in a day (Such as counting glasses of water drunk or litres etc)
Should be able to track the number of workouts
Should have a timer that can be used during workouts. 

#### Wireframe:

For this Page I decied to only implemnet 2 option which were Option one which allows the user to track the amount of water the user have intaken and option 2 which allows you to track the amount of workouts and it also have a timer implemented to allow the user to time themselves when working out.
