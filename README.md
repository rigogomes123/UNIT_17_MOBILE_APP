# Produce designs for a mobile app to meet identified requirements:

### Introduction:

You have been contacted by a local wellness spa and gym. They know you have completed a lot of research on mobile applications previously and have seen your web article. They want you to create a bespoke habit tracking application. Their only key requirements are the following:

Should be able to track the amount of water someone has drunk in a day (Such as counting glasses of water drunk or litres etc)
Should be able to track the number of workouts
Should have a timer that can be used during workouts. 

#### Wireframe:
Desighning the wireframe was the first activity i started after reading the scenario, Here's what I've done:

Default Android studio main page:

screenshot:

##### Wireframe(Android Home Page) :

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9683a15d-54d1-4c7f-8d2a-bc1a2c633bc1)

In my first wireframe design of the home screen of an android, i recreated what it would look like in android studio. The main default page

##### App's main page/ Home screen:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eba4a41f-9a4b-4c18-9302-0497cc911ff1)

The main application page will contain a background image which will probably be black or a dark style, It will contain a message welcoming the user to the application and a button(Get Started) wich will lead to start the whole application it seldf

##### App's Lanidng page:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbc9095f-c012-407c-8176-0104af606ede)

For this Page I decied to only implemnet 2 option which were Option one which allows the user to track the amount of water the user have intaken and option 2 which allows you to track the amount of workouts and it also have a timer implemented to allow the user to time themselves when working out. Regarding The background image I will implemnet a fitness like image in order to motivate the users.

##### Water Tracker Page:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/648581be-57c3-4505-b2d9-ebe1f42db889)

For this specifict design It will have two main screen, the first screen will allow the user to inter the amount of water they have drunk in either glass or ml, the secound screen will output the infomration and store it that way the user is able to keep track of their intake, regrading the background image I will probably implemnet a inmage of a person drinking water.

I got my aspiration from the following design:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db85e7f7-c36d-4a4c-9a2e-cb963580c700)


##### Timer and workout Page:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45f99c17-a098-41d2-9ca9-3f90274a9b48)

Just like the previous deisgn thiis design will also contain 2 inputs and 2 output the first input will allow the user to keep track of the amount of workouts they have done, and the secound input will be a timer wich will have 3 options START,STOP and RESET.

# Case diagram:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ef60e5c-71f6-40d2-bc1f-761b7d6b5338)

By using the case diagram it provides calrity and understanding, the functions of the application such as water intake,monitoring and calculating workouts by utilising a timer and how the users will interact with them are clearly and visually represented.

The primary actor such as the user and how they will interact with various system components are easuly readable and understandable.For instance:

"Track water intake" --> The user enters the amount of water consumption.

"Track Workouts" --> The user can record workouts that are finished.

"Workout Timer" --> During exercise, the user intiates and stops the timer.

# Psuedocode:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5539247-d58e-491c-984f-67fc2ab74290)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6c46935-89df-497f-bab3-3b00a80c55bd)

In the psuedocode I create above The syntax is very easy to understand. Th reason I chose to design a psuedocode was because:

###### Structure and Clarity:

Before getting into the complicated details of real code,psuedocode assisted me in outlining the structure and logic of my future application in simple, human redable terms. I was able to see how each feature such as timer, workout counting, and drink tracking and would function together thanks to this.

###### Easier Collaboration:

A universal instrument for communication is psuedocode. Psuedocode is understandable and accessible for stakeholders and team members.

###### Foundation for development:

For developing this projetc, psuedocode served as a blueprint.Since the logic and flow have already been sketched out, it is considerably simpler to conver psuedocode into actual code.

Overall Psuedocode was a useful tool for designing ans sketching out how my program/code will look.

# Review the mobile app designs with others to identify and inform refinements:


From the feedback I recived from two of my classmates I decied to better my design 

Feeback from "Astin Uka-wanna":


Feedback from "Favour Ajiduah":

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64b9b48b-7ef3-4ebc-b007-2df263f4d6eb)


###### Changes made:

I will now show the new wireframe that I created to meet the reponses from the feedback that I recived from my classmates:

#### main android studio screen:

## old:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/936f8fca-dafd-443d-9388-8dd8173166a1)


## new:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b4ab716-f029-46dc-84a5-0829a064daa6)


The changes made here are very little, I made a mistake, initially I thought that I needed to create a application interface but with android studio it was already created there for me, so I moved it back to its main location.

### App's main page/Home page:

## old:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90526df5-d4cb-456d-9209-86f2b69d0c3e)


## new:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7bcd0d18-42e6-47c4-8684-cbe3bf7eab8e)

In my new design I clarified where all the interactive buttons will be placed such as "Get Started" by implmentating this change I successfully met the feeback sugestion which I recvied from my classmate.

### Menu Page:

## Old:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf38be19-adb4-4a96-8f7a-922698992916)


## New:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20385362-7271-4734-b040-a7eac76669c4)

The refinemnets I made were that I changed the layout of my buttons instead of having the button side by side, I made them vertically stacked because this type of layput is oftern perfered since it can provide better readability, reponsivness and accessbility in a mobile app design. Futher more as shown in the screenshot I have met both of the suggestion from my classmate which were to accurately label my button and have a button which can lead back to the previous page.

##  Timer Page

### Old:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcd05c1c-4d16-4f17-9e35-608b2a0000ca)

### New:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30d94ea6-fb05-422b-b07a-f51007e06a27)

The refinemnets I made were In my first design I made the timer and the workout counter in the same page, whilst on my new I decided to separate them because, a application that divides its timer and workout counter into two distinct pages improves focus and streamlines the user experience. The design decision decision optimises each page for its particular purpose, minimises clutter, and enhances readability. Because users may fouces on timing or counting without interruption, it also reduces mental strain during workouts. Futhermore I also successfully used the feedback from my classmate by leballing each interactive button and having a button "Back" which can lead back to the previous page. Addtionaly I also have clear naming conventions for my button and they are easily visible.

### Workout counter page:

## Old

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61929516-187e-4e81-a162-041a767a5e1b)


## New

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d874bc1e-357a-42ea-819c-a3a205568073)

As a previous stated I seperated the workout counter and timer into 2 different pages, In my newest design Ive made it very clear where all the imputs are loctaed and where the main output will appear, in this case The "0" will be the number of workouts that will remain an output the "-" and "+" signs will add or take away from the output. Futhermore I successfully met the suggestion I recived from my classmates which were to label each interactive button and have another "back" button to lead back to the previous page inorder to benefit application flow.

### Water Tracker Page:

## Old:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd3ae1a8-40ec-41f9-9eac-a3579b6956c5)

## New:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/707e67ff-d536-4eb6-b070-75842b8a4246)

The refinemnets I made in this design were very little, I just made clear where all the inputs will be located, additonaly I also implmented a reset button so that the user can reset the timer anytime they need. Lastly I also successfully met the suggestion from my peers which were to labell each interactive button and implmnebt a button that can lead to the previous page benefiting the application flow.


Overall I was able to create a better wireframe from the feedback I recived from my peers and also just using android studio more and understanding how its syntax works.

# A review to which extend the mobile application met the identified requiremnets:

### Home page:


As the user's main hub, the home page is essential to their experiecnec and levle of involvement. The Home page of this kind of wellness focused software should provide users with a visual representation of their daily progress in addition to easy access to main functions, which include the timer, workout tracker. Showing them how many liters of water they've consumed or how many workouts they've completed, for instance, helps keep them interested and motivated.

Goal Progress indicators, including a water progress bar and a workout streak tracker, should be included on the main page in order for it to reach its full potential. These features not only improve the app's usability at a glance but also support the development of healthy behaviors. Futhermore, adding wellness themed user interface components like relaxing shades, inspiration saying, or streak badges, would improve the spa and gym branding and make the app friendlier.


### Timer page:

The timer page helps users while they work out is especially helful for timiing test breaks or interval based routines. The app should have a basic stopwatch and countdown timer in order to satisfy the requirement. It should, however, have adjustable interval clocks that let user specify work and rest such as 30 secounds of activity in order to be genuinely useful for workout treatments.

### Workout counter:

Anothor essential requirement is that the workout counter page can track the number of workouts the user completes. In its most basic form, it should enavle the user to tap once to record an exercise. Another feature I decied to implment was that the users are able to type which workout they would like to track. Features like weekly fitness objectives, achivement badges, or a streak tracker that indicates the number of consecutive days a user has been active should be included on this page to encourage habit formation and maintain user motivation.In oder to assist user visualise their consistency and gain momentum. Overall my mobile application met the requiremnet that was asked in the assignment brief.

### Water Tracker:

By allowing visitors to monitor their daily hydration,the water tracker page directly satisfies one of the spa's fundamental needs. In its most basic form, this page allows users to record how much water they have drunk in measuremnets liike mililitres by implementating all of this features my page has met the requirements which were stated in the brief.


### In summary:

In conclusion,the four main sections of my mobile application (Home,water tracker, workout counter and timer) all have distinct functions and a solid foundation.However, goal monitoring, visual feedback, customisation, and historical data should be included to each element in order to fullly satisfy the spa and gym's criterua and give users a meaningful experience.


# Justification of how decisions made during the design process ensured the design for the application will meet indentified requirements:

My application design priotitises efficacy, accessibility, and simplicity. Carefully considered design decisions that improve usability and motivation satisfy the three main need which are a water tracker, timer and a workout counter.

### Tracing Water Intake:

# optimisation of the application:




# Evaluate the design and optimised mobile app against client requiremenets


## Home screen/ page:

Optimisation:

The reason I decided to optimse a basic home screen, even rhough It fully meets the client requirements there are some issues with it, in my first design I implemented a text using a black fount it was fully visible, Here is the optimisation I have to and why I did so:


#### Improved readability:

Users can become irritaed if the text is difficult to see, particularly if it is read against the background. Optimising the design by using text shadows, readable fonts gurantees that users can comprehend the call to action or message with ease.



#### Improved viusability:

For users to know what to do first, a home screen mus have a clear visual structure.The "Get Started" button stands out more and directs the user to the next step by optimising elements like button size, placement and typography.


#### Enhanced user focus:

Distractions can be minimised and the user can concentrate on the primary action the button with the help of a clear, easthetically balanced layout that includes well paced button, background, and spacing. As a result, the app feels less complicated and more intruitive.


## This is my optimised home page:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a5da798-a0cc-44da-9754-097687669627)


## In comparsion with my old page:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/569212dc-268a-493d-b6a5-5e8f088c1fa8)


### How it meets the client requirements:

Focsuing on the design's contrast, font selection,spacing and colour coding is crucial for suitable clarity and usability. To make material easier to read, first I made sure that there was a good contrats between the background an the text to make sure the contet was easy to read.

## Menu/options page:




### Timer page:

For a number of reasons, I choose to optimise the timer page by turning the background brown and adding a timer that changes from simply "0" to "00:00" in order to better satisfy  the design requirements. FIrst, in keeping with the wellness gym/ spa designs, the brown background produces a relaxing, earthly tone. Warmth, solidity, and relaxation are frequently linked to the colour brown, which helps users create a more peaceful and focused environment, particularly while they are exercising or meditating.This improves the user experience and is consistent with the app's wellness theme.


With the timer set to start at "0" and go to "00:00" I wanted the count to feel more organic and natural. This design decision promotes clarify and functionality. Starting at "0" gives user a clear baseline, and since "00:00" is a widely accepted and readable time format, watching the timer progress offers superior visual feddback. This makes it easier for users to keep track of the length of their workouts and gurantees that the timer is not only user friendly buy compatibem with regular workout timer formats.

Additionally, by eliminating unnecessary distractions, this design change maintains the attention on the timer's primary purpose, which is to precisely record workout times. Overal this startegy gurantees that the timer page satisfies the client's need while still staying true to the overall objectives of simplicity,usability, and establishing an immersive health experience.

Overall I am extremly happ and how my timer page has turned out after optimisation, futhermore it meets the requirement that was asked in the assignment brief (Have some sort of timer that can be used to time workouts).

### My previous design:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb15db79-a108-446b-986b-2ea846e955a4)

## My optimised design:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44669772-0861-4ae7-9234-c509c4b6aafe)


## water tracker page:

My water tracker design in my first design fully meets the requiremnet as it allows the user to input tha amount of water they have drunk througout the day. I have successfully implemneted a feature which returns amount of water in militers which successfu;;y aligns with the client requiremnets for a practicual solution.

How during My first desig there was a small but important problem which I improved in my optimisation which was "back" button.  The absence of a back button to return for the previous page creates a usability problem even though the software is completely functional in terms of monitoring the water inktae and collecting input. For a smooth and clear user experience, navigation flow is essential in mobile app design. Since they might not know how to get back to the menu page or other areas of the program,users who expect to be able to switch between screen with ease may become frustarted.


#### Tracking water intake:

* Meets Requirements

The client requested this functionality, and the user input function for tracking water consumption is fully operational and provides data in mililitres.

* Navigation (Back button)

Needs improvemnets:  Users anticipate an easy way to go back to previous pages, therefore the lack of a back button is a small problem that can destract from overall user experience. This page would be much easier to navigate and would follow best practices for mobile app design if it had a back button.

#### The suggestion for optimisation.

To be able to incldude a back button that takes users to the menu page on the water tracker page. This is a little but also crucial feature that will signficantly improve the app's usability and gurantee that users can move between screens with ease

##### Conclusion:

Although my water tracking page design is up to standard and works well, a completely satisfy the client. It's a little adjustment that will ehnace navigation and give the app or a more user friendly feel.

### My optimised design:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/859f8d36-77e0-4190-9528-66398017470b)


## In comparison with my old design:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f988f58-8fc4-4107-b75c-817dda304a00)

## workout counter Page:

My current mobile app's displays a strong foundation and satisfies a number of the client's essential needs, especially those related to tracking workouts. User are able to input their preffered workout and use the counter with ease and there are button available such as increase and decrease to modify the counter. This simple interface design encourages rapid engagemnet and works especially well on mobile devices,where clarity and simplicity are essentially crucial. A wide range of users can utilise it because of the user friendly interface, which improves usability overall.

One of the client main needs is successfully met by the application ability to track daily water intake. The software allows users to input the amount of water to track the total. This feature complements the spa and gym;s well focused objectives and encourage the formation of good hydration habits. By implementing this feature, the whole application highlits itself as a more complete habit tracking look.

Futhermore, ehnacements to user feedback and data persistence could help the existing design. The app's usility as a long term tracker is limited if user input is not saved between sessions, wether through cloud synchornisation, local storage, or a leighweight database.In order to monitor progress, users anticipate that habit tracking apps will recall previous actions. Addition, by offering a more responsive and captivating interface, feedback features like animations or colour changes in reponse to button presses could improve the user experience.

Finally, even if the functional components are there, the app's attractiveness might be increased by optimising the visual design to match client's brand. The spa and gym's wellness focused concept would be reflected by using smoothing colour scheme, rounded, smooth user interface elements and consistent typography.
