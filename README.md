# Produce designs for a mobile app to meet identified requirements:

### Introduction:

You have been contacted by a local wellness spa and gym. They know you have completed a lot of research on mobile applications previously and have seen your web article. They want you to create a bespoke habit tracking application. Their only key requirements are the following:

Should be able to track the amount of water someone has drunk in a day (Such as counting glasses of water drunk or litres etc)
Should be able to track the number of workouts
Should have a timer that can be used during workouts. 

#### Wireframe:
Desighning the wireframe was the first activity i started after reading the scenario, Here's what I've done:

Default Android studio main page:

##### Wireframe(Android Home Page) :

In my first wireframe design of the home screen of an android, i recreated what it would look like in android studio. 

##### App's main page/ Home screen:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eba4a41f-9a4b-4c18-9302-0497cc911ff1)

The main application page will contain a background image which will probably be black or a dark style, It will contain a message welcoming the user to the application and a button(Get Started) wich will lead to start the whole application it seldf

##### App's Lanidng page:

For this Page I decied to only implemnet 2 option which were Option one which allows the user to track the amount of water the user have intaken and option 2 which allows you to track the amount of workouts and it also have a timer implemented to allow the user to time themselves when working out. Regarding The background image I will implemnet a fitness like image in order to motivate the users.

##### Water Tracker Page:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/648581be-57c3-4505-b2d9-ebe1f42db889)

For this specifict design It will have two main screen, the first screen will allow the user to inter the amount of water they have drunk in either glass or ml, the secound screen will output the infomration and store it that way the user is able to keep track of their intake, regrading the background image I will probably implemnet a inmage of a person drinking water.

I got my aspiration from the following design:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db85e7f7-c36d-4a4c-9a2e-cb963580c700)


##### Timer and workout Page:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45f99c17-a098-41d2-9ca9-3f90274a9b48)

Just like the previous deisgn thiis design will also contain 2 inputs and 2 output the first input will allow the user to keep track of the amount of workouts they have done, and the secound input will be a timer wich will have 3 options START,STOP and RESET.
